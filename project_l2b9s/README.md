# My Personal Project: Macro Tracker

### Calculates How Many Calories You have Consumed

For my personal project I have decided to create a ***macro tracker application***. This application
will allow users to create a profile of themselves and track their daily calorie, protein, and fat intake for the day.
Users search for what foods they have eaten, how much of that food they have ate, and calculates the
amount of calories, protein, and fat. Users can create different days when they can see a list of what they have eaten Users
can also add in new foods by entering the nutrition facts. The people that will use this application are those that want to
have a gauge on how much food they are consuming. People that want to hit or maintain their weight goals and people that want
to reach their fitness goals.

I choose this project because I am a very **active** person and I want to be able to hit my fitness goals. One of the biggest
factors of developing muscle is tracking the amount of protein and calories you have consumed. Many people do not track
their food intake, so it is hard to gauge how much calories is recommended for a healthy person. In conclusion, I want to
make this application because of my fitness journey and help gauge how much food I am eating.

### Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on this personal project I would organize the classes in the UI folder. I would refactor the
code by creating inner class. For example, for my FoodButton and FoodInfo class instead of creating another class file
I can just put it in the FoodGrid class. This will lead to having fewer class files in the UI folder which will be much
simpler to understand.

Another improvement I can make is changing my FoodList class into a singleton class. Since there is no point of creating
two separate FoodList objects. In all of my code I only created one FoodList object so by changing it a singleton class
it would the FoodList class more geared to its functions for my application. This will improve the design of my code
because now the FoodList class is more defined to its uses in my code.
